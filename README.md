# DIYnn
A small sample neural network for education purposes

# Usage
As initially configured, the program creates a data set which is an Trinary XOR with an extra, unused parameter. It then creates a simple Neural Network with 4 input nodes, 3 hidden nodes, and 2 output nodes to decide if the calculation is true or false.

The application is fairly generiticed so that the user can easily change all aspects of the network.
